        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Use rubber gloves to mince the chiles and place into a mixing bowl. 
                Add cilantro, garlic, vegetable oil, vinegar, lime juice, salt, and black pepper. Mix 
                piri piri sauce well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place chicken breast and legs into a resealable plastic bag. Pour in piri piri sauce, seal the bag, and
                shake gently to completely cover chicken. Put the bag in the refrigerator to marinate at least 4 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove bag from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before cooking to allow chicken to come to room temperature.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove chicken from the bag; discard bag and cilantro. Cook chicken on the preheaetd grill, rotating as necessary to cook 
                evenly, until juices run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 25 minutes.
